This repository accompanies the paper *[Pirone, D., Giugliano, G., Schiavo, M., Montella, A., Mugnano, M., Cerbone, V., Raia, M., Scalia, G., Kurelac, I., Medina, D. L., Capasso, M., Iolascon, A., Memmolo, P. & Ferraro, P. (2025). Holotomography-driven learning for in-silico staining of single cells in flow cytometry avoiding co-registration. bioRxiv, 2025-07. https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.22.666145]*.  
It provides the dataset to reproduce and extend the results of our proposed Holotomography-driven deep learning framework for the in-silico staining of Quantitative Phase Maps (QPMs) of single cells acquired under flow cytometry conditions.

## Dataset

The `Dataset` folder includes:  
- Training set  
- Validation set  
- Internal test set  
- Independent internal test set  
- Independent external test set  

Each sample consists of an experimental 2D QPM and its corresponding nucleus mask, obtained using the Computational Segmentation based on Statistical Inference (CSSI) algorithm applied to Holo-Tomographic Flow Cytometry data.
